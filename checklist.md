    *   Monitor and adapt to API changes in core dependencies
    *   Document version compatibility requirements
*   **[ ] Logging:** Implement structured logging (e.g., JSON) for easier analysis. Log key events, decisions, tool inputs/outputs, errors.
*   **[ ] Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in agent, tools, and API layers. Provide user-friendly error messages.
*   **[ ] Security:**
    *   Input validation for all user-provided data and tool arguments.
    *   Secure handling of API keys and secrets (e.g., `python-dotenv`, HashiCorp Vault).
    *   Regular review of dependencies for vulnerabilities.
    *   Secure code execution sandbox.
*   **[ ] Testing:**
    *   Unit tests for individual tools and critical functions.
    *   Integration tests for LangGraph flows (e.g., specific interview scenarios).
    *   E2E tests for user-facing features.
*   **[ ] Documentation:**
    *   Keep `README.md` updated.
    *   Add code comments for complex logic.
    *   Document API endpoints (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI).
*   **[ ] Configuration Management:**
    *   Use environment variables or config files for LLM model names, API keys, prompts, thresholds.
*   **[ ] Scalability & Performance:**
    *   Monitor LLM API latencies.
    *   Optimize prompts and tool logic for efficiency.
    *   Design database schemas for efficient querying.
*   **[ ] Conventional Commits:** Adhere to conventional commit message format for all changes.
*   **[ ] Regular Refactoring:** Keep the codebase clean and maintainable.

This checklist provides a roadmap. Tasks and priorities may be adjusted based on sprint reviews, feedback, and evolving requirements.
