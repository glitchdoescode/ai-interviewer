   - Define user roles (candidate, interviewer, admin)
   - Set up secure session management and role-based access control

### Technical Debt & Improvements
1. Add more comprehensive error handling in evaluation tools
2. Implement caching for LLM calls to improve performance
3. Add unit tests for the code execution and feedback systems
4. Consider adding support for more programming languages
5. Optimize performance of code execution with timeouts and resource limits
6. Review and implement explicit job role checks (potentially by adding `requires_coding: bool` to `JobRole` model in `server.py` and using it in `AIInterviewer._determine_interview_stage`) before initiating coding challenges.
7. Solidify and document the data transfer mechanism: frontend must send detailed coding results (summary from `/api/coding/submit`) in the `message` field of `ChallengeCompleteRequest` to `AIInterviewer.continue_after_challenge` for the AI to provide specific, informed feedback.

## Challenges & Considerations

1. **LLM Integration**: Successfully integrated with Gemini for multiple purposes (agent, name extraction, question generation, evaluation). The architecture is modular enough to support different models for different tasks.

2. **State Management**: Improved the state management to handle both dictionary and InterviewState objects, ensuring proper persistence between turns. Further simplified by moving to MessagesState in the refactored architecture.

3. **Testing Approach**: Updated testing for the new architecture confirms functionality, but more comprehensive tests would be valuable as we add more features.

4. **Code Execution**: Implemented a comprehensive code execution system with safety checks and detailed output analysis. Future enhancements would include a containerized execution environment for production.

5. **Persistence**: Using MongoDB for persistence with clean integration in the unified AIInterviewer class. This works well for both CLI and potential web applications.

6. **Pair Programming**: Successfully implemented a comprehensive hint generation system that provides specific, contextual guidance based on code analysis. The integration with LLMs for fallback hints ensures we can always provide useful assistance.

7. **Human-in-the-loop Implementation**: Properly implemented true human-in-the-loop functionality for coding challenges using LangGraph's interrupt and Command mechanisms, allowing for a natural pause in the interview flow while the candidate completes the coding task, followed by a seamless resumption of the interview with preserved context.

## Next Steps

1. Continue with Phase 2:
   - ✅ Implement STT/TTS integration with Deepgram
   - Design advanced AI interviewer features with adaptivity
   - Plan secure code execution sandbox using containerization
