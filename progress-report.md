### Next Steps
1. Implement AI pair programming assistant functionality
2. Set up real-time conversational interaction with STT/TTS
3. Enhance the DynamicQuestionGenerationTool with more adaptivity
4. Design a secure code execution sandbox for production use

### Technical Debt & Improvements
1. Add more comprehensive error handling in evaluation tools
2. Implement caching for LLM calls to improve performance
3. Add unit tests for the code execution and feedback systems
4. Consider adding support for more programming languages
5. Optimize performance of code execution with timeouts and resource limits

### Implemented Features & Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Question Generation**: Questions now adapt based on topic, skill level, and previous conversation.

2. **LLM-Based Candidate Name Extraction**: Replaced regex patterns with an advanced LLM-based approach for name extraction.

3. **Improved State Management**: Enhanced persistence of state between conversation turns, fixing AttributeError issues.

4. **Automatic Stage Transitions**: The interview now progresses naturally through stages based on conversation flow.

5. **Response Evaluation**: Added tools to evaluate candidate responses using LLM-based assessment.

6. **Interactive Coding Challenges**: Implemented complete coding challenge flow with:
   - Multiple sample challenges across different languages
   - Challenge selection based on topic
   - Test case evaluation
   - Hint system for candidates who get stuck
   - Language-specific validation

7. **Enhanced CLI**: Improved the command-line interface with additional parameters and better state persistence.

8. **Unified Architecture**: Refactored the codebase to use a unified AIInterviewer class that follows industry best practices.

9. **Asynchronous Interview Support**: Implemented session persistence and management:
   - MongoDB-based checkpointing for LangGraph state
   - Session management for resuming interviews
   - CLI commands for listing and resuming sessions
   - Transcript saving in multiple formats

10. **Improved Coding Evaluation**: Enhanced code evaluation with detailed analysis:
    - Secure code execution with safety checks
    - Comprehensive test case execution with detailed results
    - Code quality metrics (complexity, style, maintainability)
    - Performance metrics (execution time, success rate)
    - Tailored feedback based on candidate skill level
    - Structured feedback with strengths and improvement areas

## Challenges & Considerations

1. **LLM Integration**: Successfully integrated with Gemini for multiple purposes (agent, name extraction, question generation, evaluation). The architecture is modular enough to support different models for different tasks.

2. **State Management**: Improved the state management to handle both dictionary and InterviewState objects, ensuring proper persistence between turns. Further simplified by moving to MessagesState in the refactored architecture.

3. **Testing Approach**: Updated testing for the new architecture confirms functionality, but more comprehensive tests would be valuable as we add more features.

4. **Code Execution**: Implemented a comprehensive code execution system with safety checks and detailed output analysis. Future enhancements would include a containerized execution environment for production.

5. **Persistence**: Using MongoDB for persistence with clean integration in the unified AIInterviewer class. This works well for both CLI and potential web applications.

## Next Steps

1. Complete Sprint 6 tasks:
   - Implement AI pair programming assistance
   - Add more sophisticated hint generation
   - Expand context-aware code suggestions

2. Begin planning for Phase 2:
   - Research STT/TTS integration options
   - Design advanced AI interviewer features
   - Plan secure code execution sandbox using containerization
   - Consider automated problem generation based on job descriptions
