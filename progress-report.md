   - Voice-optimized system prompts
   - Audio recording and playback handling
   - Voice-enabled CLI interface

2. **Dynamic Question Generation**: Questions now adapt based on topic, skill level, and previous conversation.

3. **LLM-Based Candidate Name Extraction**: Replaced regex patterns with an advanced LLM-based approach for name extraction.

4. **Improved State Management**: Enhanced persistence of state between conversation turns, fixing AttributeError issues.

5. **Automatic Stage Transitions**: The interview now progresses naturally through stages based on conversation flow.

## Challenges & Considerations

1. **LLM Integration**: Successfully integrated with Gemini for multiple purposes (agent, name extraction, question generation, evaluation). The architecture is modular enough to support different models for different tasks.

2. **State Management**: Improved the state management to handle both dictionary and InterviewState objects, ensuring proper persistence between turns. Further simplified by moving to MessagesState in the refactored architecture.

3. **Testing Approach**: Updated testing for the new architecture confirms functionality, but more comprehensive tests would be valuable as we add more features.

4. **Code Execution**: Implemented a comprehensive code execution system with safety checks and detailed output analysis. Future enhancements would include a containerized execution environment for production.

5. **Persistence**: Using MongoDB for persistence with clean integration in the unified AIInterviewer class. This works well for both CLI and potential web applications.

6. **Pair Programming**: Successfully implemented a comprehensive hint generation system that provides specific, contextual guidance based on code analysis. The integration with LLMs for fallback hints ensures we can always provide useful assistance.

7. **Human-in-the-loop Implementation**: Properly implemented true human-in-the-loop functionality for coding challenges using LangGraph's interrupt and Command mechanisms, allowing for a natural pause in the interview flow while the candidate completes the coding task, followed by a seamless resumption of the interview with preserved context.

## Next Steps

1. Continue with Phase 2:
   - ✅ Implement STT/TTS integration with Deepgram
   - Design advanced AI interviewer features with adaptivity
   - Plan secure code execution sandbox using containerization
   - Consider automated problem generation based on job descriptions
   - Explore additional language support for voice interactions
