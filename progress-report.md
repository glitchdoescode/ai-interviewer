# AI Interviewer Platform - Progress Report

## Current Status Summary
The AI Interviewer platform has a functional core interview system with completed sprints for foundation setup, dynamic Q&A, interactive coding challenges, evaluation & reporting, architecture refactoring, and enhanced features. We've implemented a FastAPI backend with MongoDB persistence and a React web frontend, along with voice interaction capabilities using Deepgram's API.

The most recent implementation adds job role-specific coding challenge initiation, allowing the system to determine whether to offer coding challenges based on the specific job role requirements.
