# AI Interviewer Platform - Progress Report

## Current Status Summary
The AI Interviewer platform has a functional core interview system with completed sprints for foundation setup, dynamic Q&A, interactive coding challenges, evaluation & reporting, architecture refactoring, and enhanced features. We've implemented a FastAPI backend with MongoDB persistence and a React web frontend, along with voice interaction capabilities using Deepgram's API.

The most recent implementation adds a secure Docker-based code execution sandbox, enabling safe execution of candidate code in isolated containers with resource limits and security constraints, significantly enhancing the platform's security and reliability.

## Completed Tasks

### Core Architecture and Features
- ✅ Complete LangGraph workflow implementation with proper state management
- ✅ Dynamic question generation with context awareness
- ✅ Interactive coding challenges with challenge selection and evaluation
- ✅ Human-in-the-loop functionality for coding challenges
- ✅ Detailed candidate evaluation with structured scoring
- ✅ Report generation with performance statistics
- ✅ Asynchronous interview support with session persistence
- ✅ Enhanced code evaluation with detailed analysis
- ✅ AI pair programming with hint generation
- ✅ Voice interaction using Deepgram's API for STT/TTS
- ✅ Secure code execution sandbox using Docker containers

### API and Frontend
- ✅ FastAPI server with comprehensive REST endpoints
- ✅ MongoDB persistence with proper connection handling
- ✅ React web frontend with chat interface and voice capabilities
- ✅ Session management and interview history
- ✅ API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI

### Recent Implementations
- ✅ Enhanced DynamicQuestionGenerationTool with candidate response incorporation
- ✅ Improved response analysis for depth of understanding assessment
- ✅ Refined interview_agent prompts for natural transitions and empathetic responses
- ✅ Added job role-specific coding challenge initiation with custom logic for role requirements
- ✅ Implemented streamlined coding submission and feedback flow
- ✅ Developed secure code execution sandbox:
  - Created Docker-based sandbox for isolated code execution with resource limits
  - Implemented support for both Python and JavaScript execution
  - Added automatic fallback to less secure methods when Docker is unavailable
  - Enhanced security with read-only filesystem and network isolation
  - Integrated with existing code challenge workflow

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Code Evolution Tracking**:
   - Modify `InterviewState` to store snapshots of candidate's code at submission points
   - Add visualization of code changes over time

2. **Automated Problem Generation**:
   - Design tools to generate coding challenges based on job description
   - Develop robust prompts for creating relevant test cases

### Future Enhancements
1. **Authentication & User Management**:
   - Implement basic email/password authentication
   - Add OAuth integration for third-party login
   - Define user roles (candidate, interviewer, admin)

2. **Production Deployment**:
   - Finalize containerization with Docker Compose
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment
   - Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging
   - Perform security audit and penetration testing

## Technical Debt & Improvements
1. ⚠️ Add more comprehensive error handling in evaluation tools
2. ⚠️ Implement caching for LLM calls to improve performance
3. ⚠️ Add unit tests for the code execution and feedback systems
4. ⚠️ Support more programming languages in code execution
5. ⚠️ Optimize performance with timeouts and resource limits
