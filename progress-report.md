# AI Interviewer Platform - Progress Report

## Current Status
We have completed the initial implementation of the AI Interviewer platform's core components, including dynamic question generation, enhanced stage management, and interactive coding challenges. The system can now conduct a complete end-to-end technical interview with Q&A, coding challenges, and feedback.

### Latest Updates
- Implemented comprehensive evaluation rubric using Pydantic models
- Created evaluation agent using LangGraph for structured interview assessment
- Added support for Q&A, technical, and soft skills evaluation with detailed scoring
- Enhanced state management and persistence for evaluation workflow
- Fixed LangGraph API compatibility issue by updating StateGraph initialization parameter from 'checkpointer' to 'checkpoint' to match the latest API version
- Enhanced error handling and logging around state management and checkpointing
- Improved documentation around state persistence between conversation turns

### Implementation Progress

#### Completed Sprints
1. **Foundation & Core LangGraph Setup (Sprint 1)**
   - ‚úÖ Full project structure and dependency setup
   - ‚úÖ Core LangGraph workflow implementation
   - ‚úÖ Basic conversation flow with state management

2. **Interview Flow & Question Generation (Sprint 2)**
   - ‚úÖ Dynamic question generation based on context
   - ‚úÖ Adaptive follow-up questions
   - ‚úÖ Stage transition logic

3. **Coding Challenge Integration (Sprint 3)**
   - ‚úÖ Interactive coding environment setup
   - ‚úÖ Code execution and validation
   - ‚úÖ AI pair programming assistance

4. **Evaluation System (Sprint 4 - In Progress)**
   - ‚úÖ Basic evaluation rubric definition
   - ‚úÖ Evaluation agent implementation with LangGraph
   - üîÑ Advanced scoring algorithms
   - üîÑ Bias detection and mitigation
   - ‚è≥ Report generation and formatting

### Next Steps
1. Complete remaining evaluation system components:
   - Implement advanced scoring algorithms
   - Add bias detection and mitigation
   - Create detailed report generation
2. Begin work on the UI/UX components
3. Enhance error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. Add comprehensive testing suite

### Technical Debt & Issues
- Need to implement more robust error handling in evaluation agent
- Consider adding validation for evaluation results
- Plan for scaling evaluation system with high concurrent usage

### Notes
The evaluation system implementation follows the rubric-based assessment approach outlined in the PRD, with support for both technical and soft skills evaluation. The LangGraph-based evaluation agent provides a structured way to assess candidate performance while maintaining consistency and fairness.

## Challenges & Considerations

1. **LLM Integration**: Successfully integrated with Gemini for multiple purposes (agent, name extraction, question generation, evaluation). The architecture is modular enough to support different models for different tasks.

2. **State Management**: Improved the state management to handle both dictionary and InterviewState objects, ensuring proper persistence between turns.

3. **Testing Approach**: Basic testing in the CLI confirms functionality, but more comprehensive tests would be valuable as we add more features.

4. **Code Execution**: For the MVP, we've implemented a placeholder code evaluation system. A future enhancement would be to safely execute submitted code against test cases.

5. **Persistence**: Currently using MemorySaver for persistence. This works well for the CLI, but a more robust solution might be needed for production use.

## Next Steps

1. Complete Sprint 4 tasks:
   - Implement comprehensive evaluation logic
   - Enhance CLI interface for better coding experience
   - Add structured interview report generation
   - Improve candidate scoring system

2. Begin planning for Phase 2:
   - Research STT/TTS integration options
   - Design advanced AI interviewer features
   - Plan secure code execution sandbox
   - Consider automated problem generation
