# AI Interviewer Platform - Progress Report

## Current Status
We have completed the initial implementation of the AI Interviewer platform's core components, including dynamic question generation, enhanced stage management, and interactive coding challenges. The system can now conduct a complete end-to-end technical interview with Q&A, coding challenges, and feedback.

## Implemented Features & Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Question Generation**: Questions now adapt based on topic, skill level, and previous conversation.

2. **LLM-Based Candidate Name Extraction**: Replaced regex patterns with an advanced LLM-based approach for name extraction.

3. **Improved State Management**: Enhanced persistence of state between conversation turns, fixing AttributeError issues.

4. **Automatic Stage Transitions**: The interview now progresses naturally through stages based on conversation flow.

5. **Response Evaluation**: Added tools to evaluate candidate responses using LLM-based assessment.

6. **Interactive Coding Challenges**: Implemented complete coding challenge flow with:
   - Multiple sample challenges across different languages
   - Challenge selection based on topic
   - Test case evaluation
   - Hint system for candidates who get stuck
   - Language-specific validation

7. **Enhanced CLI**: Improved the command-line interface with additional parameters and better state persistence.

## Challenges & Considerations

1. **LLM Integration**: Successfully integrated with Gemini for multiple purposes (agent, name extraction, question generation, evaluation). The architecture is modular enough to support different models for different tasks.

2. **State Management**: Improved the state management to handle both dictionary and InterviewState objects, ensuring proper persistence between turns.

3. **Testing Approach**: Basic testing in the CLI confirms functionality, but more comprehensive tests would be valuable as we add more features.

4. **Code Execution**: For the MVP, we've implemented a placeholder code evaluation system. A future enhancement would be to safely execute submitted code against test cases.

5. **Persistence**: Currently using MemorySaver for persistence. This works well for the CLI, but a more robust solution might be needed for production use.
