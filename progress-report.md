# AI Interviewer Platform - Progress Report

## Current Status
We have completed the initial implementation of the AI Interviewer platform's core components, including dynamic question generation, enhanced stage management, interactive coding challenges, and now a comprehensive rubric-based evaluation system.

### Latest Updates
- Implemented rubric-based evaluation system with Pydantic models for structured scoring
- Added trust score calculation for evaluation confidence tracking
- Enhanced state management to handle detailed QA and coding evaluations
- Improved evaluation feedback with detailed justifications for each criterion

### Implementation Progress

#### Completed Sprints
1. **Foundation & Core LangGraph Setup (Sprint 1)**
   - ✅ Full project structure and dependency setup
   - ✅ Core LangGraph workflow implementation
   - ✅ Basic state management and persistence

2. **Dynamic Q&A Implementation (Sprint 2)**
   - ✅ Question generation with context awareness
   - ✅ Response handling and state tracking
   - ✅ Stage transition logic

3. **Interactive Coding Challenges (Sprint 3)**
   - ✅ Basic code execution environment
   - ✅ Challenge state management
   - ✅ Code submission and validation

4. **Basic Evaluation & Reporting (Sprint 4)**
   - ✅ Rubric definition with Pydantic models
   - ✅ Enhanced evaluation tool with structured scoring
   - ✅ Trust score implementation for evaluation confidence
   - ✅ Integrated evaluation into state management

### Next Steps
1. Implement detailed reporting generation
2. Add support for asynchronous interview sessions
3. Enhance the coding challenge evaluation with more detailed metrics
4. Implement the AI pair programming assistant

### Technical Debt & Improvements
1. Add more comprehensive error handling in evaluation tools
2. Implement caching for LLM calls to improve performance
3. Add unit tests for the evaluation system
4. Consider adding support for custom evaluation criteria

### Implemented Features & Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Question Generation**: Questions now adapt based on topic, skill level, and previous conversation.

2. **LLM-Based Candidate Name Extraction**: Replaced regex patterns with an advanced LLM-based approach for name extraction.

3. **Improved State Management**: Enhanced persistence of state between conversation turns, fixing AttributeError issues.

4. **Automatic Stage Transitions**: The interview now progresses naturally through stages based on conversation flow.

5. **Response Evaluation**: Added tools to evaluate candidate responses using LLM-based assessment.

6. **Interactive Coding Challenges**: Implemented complete coding challenge flow with:
   - Multiple sample challenges across different languages
   - Challenge selection based on topic
   - Test case evaluation
   - Hint system for candidates who get stuck
   - Language-specific validation

7. **Enhanced CLI**: Improved the command-line interface with additional parameters and better state persistence.

## Challenges & Considerations

1. **LLM Integration**: Successfully integrated with Gemini for multiple purposes (agent, name extraction, question generation, evaluation). The architecture is modular enough to support different models for different tasks.

2. **State Management**: Improved the state management to handle both dictionary and InterviewState objects, ensuring proper persistence between turns.

3. **Testing Approach**: Basic testing in the CLI confirms functionality, but more comprehensive tests would be valuable as we add more features.

4. **Code Execution**: For the MVP, we've implemented a placeholder code evaluation system. A future enhancement would be to safely execute submitted code against test cases.

5. **Persistence**: Currently using MemorySaver for persistence. This works well for the CLI, but a more robust solution might be needed for production use.

## Next Steps

1. Complete Sprint 4 tasks:
   - Implement comprehensive evaluation logic
   - Enhance CLI interface for better coding experience
   - Add structured interview report generation
   - Improve candidate scoring system

2. Begin planning for Phase 2:
   - Research STT/TTS integration options
   - Design advanced AI interviewer features
   - Plan secure code execution sandbox
   - Consider automated problem generation
