# 9-2 Build Custom UI Component Library

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Create a comprehensive library of reusable UI components that match the mockup designs and utilize the professional blue design system. These components will provide consistent styling, behavior, and accessibility across the application while maintaining the sophisticated aesthetic shown in the UI mockups.

## Requirements

1. **Button Components**
   - Primary button (solid blue with white text)
   - Secondary button (blue outline)
   - Ghost button (blue text)
   - Icon buttons for actions
   - Loading states and disabled states
   - Size variants (sm, md, lg, xl)

2. **Card Components**
   - Basic card with shadow and border
   - Feature cards with icons
   - Progress cards with status indicators
   - Interview stage cards
   - Statistics/metrics cards

3. **Form Components**
   - Professional input fields
   - Textarea with consistent styling
   - Select dropdowns
   - Checkbox and radio components
   - Form validation styling
   - File upload components

4. **Progress Components**
   - Step indicators (numbered circles)
   - Progress bars with percentage
   - Status badges
   - Timeline components

5. **Layout Components**
   - Professional header/navigation
   - Sidebar components
   - Container/wrapper components
   - Grid layout utilities

6. **Data Display Components**
   - Tables with sorting and filtering
   - List components
   - Avatar components
   - Status indicators

## Implementation Plan

1. **Create Component Directory Structure**
   - Organize components by category
   - Create component files with proper exports
   - Set up component documentation

2. **Implement Core Components**
   - Start with most frequently used components
   - Ensure all components use design system tokens
   - Add proper TypeScript types and PropTypes

3. **Add Advanced Components**
   - Complex form components
   - Data visualization elements
   - Interactive components

4. **Create Component Stories/Examples**
   - Document usage examples
   - Create interactive demos
   - Provide implementation guidelines

## Test Plan

**Objective**: Verify all components render correctly, are accessible, and follow design system

**Test Scope**: Component rendering, accessibility, responsive behavior, theming

**Key Test Scenarios**:
1. All components render without errors
2. Components respond to different props correctly
3. Accessibility features work (keyboard nav, screen readers, focus management)
4. Components are responsive across breakpoints
5. Design system tokens are properly applied
6. Components work with both light and potential dark themes

**Success Criteria**: 
- All components pass accessibility audits
- Components render consistently across browsers
- Props and variants work as documented
- Components integrate seamlessly with existing pages

## Verification

- [ ] Button components with all variants implemented
- [ ] Card components with elevation and proper spacing
- [ ] Form components with validation styling
- [ ] Progress indicators matching mockup designs
- [ ] Layout components for consistent page structure
- [ ] All components use design system tokens
- [ ] Components are accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Components are responsive
- [ ] TypeScript types/PropTypes defined
- [ ] Usage documentation created
