# 10-12 E2E CoS Test for ATS Integration and Applicant Management

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

This task involves comprehensive end-to-end testing of the complete ATS integration and applicant management workflow. It will verify that all components work together correctly and that the system satisfies the Conditions of Satisfaction (CoS) for PBI-10. This testing will validate the entire flow from ATS integration to job description import, interview content approval, candidate invitation, and interview completion.

## Requirements

1. All components of the ATS integration and applicant management system must work together correctly
2. The system must satisfy all Conditions of Satisfaction (CoS) for PBI-10
3. Testing must cover all key user flows and edge cases
4. Performance and security must be verified under realistic usage conditions
5. Test documentation must be comprehensive and reusable for future regression testing

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Test Planning and Environment Setup (1 day)

1. **Create Test Plan**
   - Define test scenarios covering all CoS requirements
   - Create test matrices for different ATS providers
   - Define test data requirements
   - Document expected outcomes for each test

2. **Set Up Test Environment**
   - Configure isolated test database
   - Set up test ATS connector with mock data
   - Create test organization accounts
   - Set up monitoring and logging for test runs

### Phase 2: Component Testing (2 days)

1. **ATS Integration Tests**

   - Verify approval workflows
   - Test content versioning and updates
   - Validate content linking to job descriptions

3. **Notification System Tests**
   - Test email template rendering
   - Verify email delivery and tracking
   - Test invitation token generation and validation
   - Validate bulk invitation functionality

### Phase 3: End-to-End Flow Testing (2 days)

1. **Organization Setup Flow**

### Phase 4: Performance and Security Testing (1 day)

1. **Performance Testing**
   - Test system under load with multiple organizations
   - Verify concurrent invitation sending
   - Test database performance with large datasets
   - Validate API response times under load

2. **Security Testing**
   - Test multi-tenant data isolation
   - Verify token security and expiration
   - Test permission boundaries between organizations
   - Validate secure storage of ATS credentials

## Verification

### Test Scenarios
1. **Complete ATS Integration Flow**
   - Connect to ATS
   - Import job descriptions and candidates
   - Create and approve interview content
   - Send invitations to candidates
   - Conduct interviews
   - Export results back to ATS

2. **Multi-Organization Isolation**
   - Create multiple test organizations
   - Import similar job descriptions
   - Verify data isolation between organizations
   - Test permissions and access controls

3. **Error Handling and Recovery**
   - Test ATS connection failures
   - Verify email delivery retries
   - Test invalid token handling
   - Validate error reporting and notifications

### Success Criteria
