# PBI-10: Multi-User Architecture with ATS Integration and Applicant Management

## Overview
This PBI addresses the need to transform the AI Interviewer into a multi-user platform that integrates with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), manages job descriptions and coding problems, and handles applicant interactions through automated notifications. The system will allow employers to review and approve interview questions and coding challenges for specific job postings, and then automatically invite shortlisted candidates to take AI-driven interviews.

## Problem Statement
Currently, the AI Interviewer system operates primarily as a standalone application without direct integration with existing HR workflows. Recruiters must manually set up interviews and manage the entire process outside their ATS. There's no structured way to:
1. Import job descriptions and requirements from an ATS
2. Create and approve customized questions and coding problems for specific job postings
3. Automatically invite shortlisted candidates to interviews
4. Manage the flow of candidates through the hiring pipeline

## User Stories

### Employer/Recruiter User Stories
- **As an** employer/recruiter,
- **I want to** connect the AI Interviewer system to our ATS,
- **So that** I can seamlessly import job descriptions, requirements, and candidate information.

- **As an** employer/recruiter,
- **I want to** review and approve interview questions and coding challenges for specific job descriptions,
- **So that** candidates are evaluated based on criteria relevant to the role.

- **As an** employer/recruiter,
- **I want to** automatically send interview invitations to shortlisted candidates,
- **So that** I can streamline the interview process and reduce manual coordination.

### Candidate User Stories
- **As a** job applicant,
- **I want to** receive a clear invitation with instructions for my AI interview,
- **So that** I can prepare properly and understand the process.

- **As a** job applicant,
- **I want to** be assessed on relevant skills and challenges specific to the job I applied for,
- **So that** the evaluation accurately reflects my suitability for the position.

## Technical Approach

### ATS Integration
1. **Develop ATS Connector Module**:
   - Create a flexible integration framework supporting common ATS APIs
   - Initially focus on webhook-based integrations and REST APIs
   - Support data mapping between ATS schemas and internal schemas
   - Implement authentication and secure data transmission

2. **Job Description and Requirements Import**:
   - Create models for job postings linked to ATS data
   - Build import workflows for job descriptions, requirements, and skills
   - Implement validation and preprocessing of imported data

3. **Candidate Data Management**:
   - Design candidate models linked to ATS records
   - Build secure data storage with proper access controls
   - Implement GDPR-compliant data handling and retention policies

### Interview Content Management
1. **Question and Challenge Library**:
   - Create database models for reusable interview questions and coding challenges
   - Implement tagging by skill, seniority level, and job category
   - Build review and approval workflows for content

2. **Job-Specific Interview Templates**:
   - Create interview template models associated with job descriptions
   - Implement selection and customization of questions for specific jobs
   - Build employer review and approval workflow

3. **Automated Content Generation**:
   - Enhance AI capabilities to generate relevant questions based on job descriptions
   - Implement quality filters and approval workflows for generated content

### Candidate Notification System
1. **Email Notification Service**:
   - Create email templating system with customizable messages
   - Implement secure email delivery service with tracking
   - Build scheduling system for timed invitations

2. **SMS Notification Service** (optional):
   - Create SMS templating for interview invitations
   - Implement SMS delivery service with tracking
   - Ensure compliance with SMS regulations

3. **Applicant Portal**:
   - Create personalized login for candidates receiving invitations
   - Build interview scheduling interface
   - Implement status tracking and reminder system

### Multi-User Access Control
1. **Role-Based Access Control**:
   - Enhance existing user model with organization relationships
   - Implement organization-level data isolation
   - Create role-based permissions for different user types

2. **Authentication Enhancements**:
   - Support organization-based SSO
   - Implement secure invitation token authentication for candidates
   - Create audit logging for all authentication events

## UX/UI Considerations

### Employer Interface
1. **ATS Connection Dashboard**:
   - Clear visualization of connection status
   - Simple setup flow for new ATS connections
   - Troubleshooting tools for connection issues

2. **Job Description Management**:
   - Interface for importing and managing job descriptions
   - Editing tools for customizing imported content
   - Preview of how job details will appear to candidates

3. **Interview Content Management**:
   - Library view of available questions and challenges
   - Tools for creating and editing content
   - Approval workflow interface

4. **Candidate Management**:
   - View of candidates in the pipeline
   - Interface for manual and automatic invitation triggering
   - Status tracking of interview invitations and completions

### Candidate Experience
1. **Email/SMS Invitation**:
   - Clear, branded invitation templates
   - Direct links to access the interview
   - Clear instructions and expectations

2. **Interview Portal**:
   - Customized welcome based on job description
   - Clear presentation of job-specific questions and challenges
   - Consistent experience with the standalone interviewer

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **ATS Integration**:
   - System can connect to at least one major ATS via API
   - Job descriptions and requirements can be imported automatically
   - Candidate data can be imported with proper permissions
   - Interview results can be exported back to ATS

2. **Content Management**:
   - Employers can review and approve interview questions and coding challenges
   - Interview content can be customized for specific job descriptions
   - System maintains a library of reusable content

3. **Notification System**:
   - System can automatically send email invitations to candidates
   - Email templates are customizable and include all necessary information
   - Delivery and open rates are tracked

4. **User Management**:
   - System supports organization-level user management
   - Different permission levels exist for admins, recruiters, and candidates
   - Data is properly isolated between organizations

5. **Candidate Experience**:
   - Candidates receive clear invitations with all necessary information
   - Interviews are customized based on the job description
   - Interview results are properly associated with the correct job application

## Dependencies
- Access to ATS vendor APIs or webhook documentation
- Email delivery service with tracking capabilities
- Enhanced database capacity for multi-tenant data storage
- Legal review of data handling practices for compliance

## Open Questions
1. Which specific ATS systems should be prioritized for initial integration?
2. What level of customization should be allowed for interview questions vs. using AI-generated content?
3. How long should candidate data be retained after interviews are completed?
4. Should the system support scheduling of interviews or allow candidates to take them at any time?
5. What metrics should be tracked to measure the effectiveness of the automated invitation process?
