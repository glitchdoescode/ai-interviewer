# AI Interviewer Platform Shortcomings

This document outlines the current shortcomings in the AI Interviewer platform that need to be addressed before proceeding with subsequent tasks.

## 1. Memory/State Persistence Issues

### Problem
The current implementation of state persistence in the AI Interviewer doesn't effectively manage long-running conversations. As conversations grow longer, context is lost, which affects the interviewer's ability to maintain a coherent interview flow.

### LangGraph Documentation Reference
- [LangGraph Memory Management](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/)
- [Managing Long Conversation History](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/#managing-long-conversation-history)
- [Summarizing Past Conversations](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/#summarizing-past-conversations)

### Implementation Ideas
- Implement advanced memory mechanisms like `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`
- Implement context summarization to maintain important information while reducing token usage
- Better segregate different types of information (candidate info, technical evaluations, etc.)

## 2. System Name Configurability (Completed)

### Problem
~~The AI interviewer did not have a configurable name, resulting in less natural and personalized interactions with candidates.~~

### Solution Implemented
- Added `SYSTEM_NAME` configuration variable in `config.py` with a default value of "Dhruv"
- Updated system prompt template to include the interviewer's name
- Modified format calls to pass the system name to the prompt
- Updated prompt to instruct the interviewer to occasionally refer to itself by name

## 3. Text-to-Speech Compatibility Issues

### Problem
The generated text from the AI interviewer isn't always optimized for speech synthesis, resulting in unnatural-sounding audio output.

### Documentation Reference
- [Deepgram TTS Documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/text-to-speech)
- [Streaming TTS Integration](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/streaming/)

### Implementation Ideas
- Format text output to include pauses and emphasis for more natural speech
- Implement SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) formatting for better speech synthesis
- Optimize sentence length and structure for better audio delivery

## 4. System Latency Issues

### Problem
The current system experiences latency issues, particularly during longer interviews and when handling complex responses.

### Documentation Reference
- [LangGraph Streaming Concepts](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/streaming/)
- [Optimizing LangGraph Flows](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/node-retries/)

### Implementation Ideas
- Implement more efficient state management to reduce processing time
- Optimize tool calls and database operations
- Implement streaming responses to improve perceived responsiveness
- Review and optimize conditional edges and transition logic

## 5. Real-time Audio Streaming Issues

### Problem
The current implementation doesn't support true real-time audio streaming, leading to a less interactive interview experience.

### Documentation Reference
- [LiveKit Documentation](https://docs.livekit.io/)
- [LangGraph Streaming Concepts](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/streaming/)

### Implementation Ideas
- Implement LiveKit for real-time bidirectional audio streaming
- Set up client-to-server and server-to-client audio streams
- Integrate streaming audio with real-time transcription
- Optimize for low-latency audio transmission

## Next Steps

After addressing these shortcomings, the AI Interviewer platform will be better positioned to provide a more natural and effective interview experience. Each issue should be addressed methodically, with careful testing to ensure improvements don't introduce new problems.
