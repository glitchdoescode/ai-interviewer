# AI Interviewer System Shortcomings

This document outlines current system shortcomings and planned improvements for the AI Interviewer platform. Items marked as ✅ have been addressed, while ⏳ indicates work in progress and ❌ indicates items still to be implemented.

## Core State Management & Performance

### S1.1: Enhanced Conversation State Management ✅

**Status: Implemented**

The system now features a comprehensive memory management system with:

- ✅ Enhanced `InterviewState` structure for comprehensive data capture
- ✅ Advanced memory mechanisms using LangGraph's MongoDBSaver and MongoDBStore
- ✅ Cross-thread memory persistence for remembering candidates across interview sessions
- ✅ Proper loading/saving of all state components
- ✅ Support for long-form context management through intelligent summarization

Implementation details:
- Created `InterviewMemoryManager` class in `ai_interviewer/utils/memory_manager.py`
- Added cross-thread memory persistence using LangGraph's store capabilities
- Enhanced AIInterviewer class to use both thread-level and cross-thread memory
- Added memory search and profile management API endpoints

See `docs/memory_management.md` for complete documentation of the enhanced memory system.

### S1.2: System Name Configurability ✅

**Status: Implemented**

The system name is now fully configurable across all components:

- ✅ Added `SYSTEM_NAME` to `ai_interviewer/utils/config.py`
- ✅ Updated all hardcoded system name references in prompts
- ✅ Created configuration setting for changing system name
- ✅ Ensured name changes propagate through the entire system

### S1.3: Optimizing LangGraph Responsiveness ⏳

**Status: Partially implemented**

Some performance improvements have been made but further optimization is needed:

- ✅ Improved memory management to reduce database operations
- ✅ Implemented connection pooling for MongoDB operations 
- ⏳ Profile graph execution to identify bottlenecks
- ❌ Optimize tool calls, especially slow ones like `execute_candidate_code`
- ❌ Review and optimize conditional edges and transition logic
- ❌ Implement streaming for intermediate steps

## Voice Experience Enhancements

### S2.1: TTS Naturalness Improvements ❌

**Status: Not implemented**

- ❌ Experiment with Deepgram voice options and settings
- ❌ Refine prompts for more conversational LLM output
- ❌ Implement SSML support for better speech synthesis control
- ❌ Research and evaluate alternative TTS services if needed
- ❌ Create A/B testing mechanism for voice quality comparison

### S2.2: LiveKit Integration for Real-time Audio ❌

**Status: Not implemented**

- ❌ Set up LiveKit server and add required dependencies
- ❌ Modify `server.py` to handle LiveKit room management and tokens
- ❌ Implement real-time audio streaming
- ❌ Update frontend to use LiveKit client SDK
- ❌ Measure and optimize latency in audio transmission

For more information on LiveKit integration, see:
- [LiveKit Documentation](https://docs.livekit.io/)
- [LiveKit Server GitHub](https://github.com/livekit/livekit)
- [LiveKit Client SDK](https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-js)

## Security & Quality Improvements

### S3.1: Code Execution Sandbox Security ❌

**Status: Not implemented**

- ❌ Update Docker base images to latest secure versions
- ❌ Add additional container restrictions
- ❌ Review and secure generated runner scripts
- ❌ Implement more robust input sanitization
- ❌ Phase out or restrict the legacy `CodeExecutor`

### S3.2: Error Handling and Resilience ⏳

**Status: Partially implemented**

- ✅ Enhanced error handling in memory management system
- ✅ Proper cleanup of database connections and resources
- ⏳ Replace generic exception handling with specific exceptions
- ❌ Implement retry mechanisms with backoff for external API calls
- ❌ Define clear error responses for all API endpoints

### S3.3: Test Coverage Expansion ❌

**Status: Not implemented**

- ❌ Create unit tests for core utilities and tools
- ❌ Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- ❌ Add tests for LangGraph flow and state transitions
- ❌ Create specific tests for Docker sandbox and code execution
- ❌ Set up CI pipeline for automated testing

### S3.4: Documentation and Comments ⏳

**Status: Partially implemented**

- ✅ Added detailed documentation for memory management system
- ✅ Improved inline comments for memory-related functionality
- ⏳ Generate or create architecture diagrams
- ❌ Update API documentation with more examples
- ❌ Create developer onboarding documentation

## Next Steps

The following improvements are prioritized for upcoming development:

1. Complete optimization of LangGraph responsiveness
2. Implement LiveKit integration for real-time audio
3. Enhance security of code execution sandbox
4. Expand test coverage and improve documentation
